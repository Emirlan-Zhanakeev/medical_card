        <p class="center-text">Punctuality: It is crucial to arrive on time for your appointment. In case of non-arrival, there may be consequences, such as a fine or the need to reschedule. We value the time of both our doctors and patients, so please plan accordingly and avoid any unnecessary delays.<br>
            <br>
            Early Arrival: We recommend arriving 10 to 5 minutes before your scheduled appointment. This allows for a smoother check-in process and ensures that you can enter the doctor's office promptly. Please consider potential traffic or other unforeseen circumstances when planning your journey.<br>
            <br>
            Check-in Procedure: Upon arrival, please approach the reception desk and inform the staff of your appointment. They will guide you through the check-in process and provide any necessary forms or information.<br>
            <br>
            Preparedness: To make the most of your appointment, come prepared with any relevant medical history, documentation, or questions you may have for the doctor. This will help facilitate a productive and comprehensive consultation.<br>
